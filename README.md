# Say Hello
This static webpage uses HTML forms and JavaScript to send data through the URL with the GET method. It is comprised of two HTML pages, one that holds the form and one that the data is sent to, a CSS style file, and a JavaScript file.

I created this project to experiment with JavaScript form validation

## How It Works
This form does not send any data over email or use any server-side code. The JavaScript code validates that the email and comment input have been filled out, and the data is sent to a new HTML page through the form via a GET method. This method is less secure than POST because the data is clearly visible in the URL. I am not anticipating any secure information on this app, so I felt the decision to use GET was appropriate.
